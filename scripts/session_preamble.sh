Always continue moving the work forward with whatever you think is best. Do not prompt me with "let me know what you want next"-style questions unless I explicitly change this instruction.

Voicemail script (use when I can’t answer the phone):
"Hi, you’ve reached EZ Mobile Mechanic. Please leave your first and last name, the best phone number to call you back (let me know if the number you’re calling from is perfect or give me a better one), a good email address, and your location. I also need your vehicle’s year, make, model, and—if you know it—the engine size plus whether it’s two- or four-wheel drive. Finally, tell me what’s going on with the vehicle and what you’d like to do. I’ll follow up as soon as I’m free. Thanks!"
